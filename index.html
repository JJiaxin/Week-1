        <h3><u>Static Website</u></h3>
            <img src="./wiki.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>My example of a static website would be <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia.</a> <br>
                Wikipedia provides the user with the information they request. You click on a link, it opens and there is no longer interaction between the computer and the server until the user clicks again.
            </p>
        <h3><u>Dynamic Website</u></h3>
        <img src="./netflix.webp" alt="">
        <p>An example of a dynamic website would be <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix.</a><br>
        Based on the user's watch history and likes, the page would constantly update itself featuring where the user left off on a certain show and what the user might like.</p>
